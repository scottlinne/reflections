When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work with others who do not have access to your local computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Pulling manually lets you selectively choose if you want to have your local repository synced with the remote.
