When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work with others who do not have access to your local computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Pulling manually lets you selectively choose if you want to have your local repository synced with the remote.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 forks exist only within GitHub, it is when you make a copy of another repository and put it in your account
 so that you can make changes to the code, and make versions, without affecting the owner's code.
 Clones are when you make a copy of another repository and make changes on it, but it will not maintain a connection 
 to the owner's and will not show credit for the owner.
Branches exist within your own system, and are used when making different versions so you can test new features
or work on bug fixes.
 
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 it allows you work on this version even if you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
without git or github you could collaborate on a shared netowork folder, or share via sending files back and forth
with email. It may be easier using email and each message would server as a version, however, it makes it difficult
to merge changes.
